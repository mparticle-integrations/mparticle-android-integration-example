/**
 *
 * This is an mParticle kit, used to extend the functionality of mParticle SDK. Most Kits are wrappers/adapters
 * to a 3rd party SDK, primarily used to map analogous public mParticle APIs onto a 3rd-party API/platform.
 *
 *
 * Follow the steps below to implement your kit:
 *
 *  - Edit ./build.gradle to add any necessary dependencies, such as your company's SDK
 *  - Rename this file/class, using your company name as the prefix, ie "AcmeKit"
 *  - View the javadocs to learn more about the KitIntegration class as well as the interfaces it defines.
 *  - Choose the additional interfaces that you need and have this class implement them,
 *    ie 'AcmeKit extends KitIntegration implements KitIntegration.PushListener'
 *
 *  In addition to this file, you also will need to edit:
 *  - ./build.gradle (as explained above)
 *  - ./README.md
 *  - ./src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
 *  - ./consumer-proguard.pro

         *
         * If you forward any events on startup that are analagous to any mParticle messages types, return them here
         * as ReportingMessage objects. Otherwise, return null.
